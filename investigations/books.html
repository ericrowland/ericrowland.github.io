<p>Most of these books provide good information in an enjoyable way, and each has its own unique bits of insight.  In the following descriptions, I've tried to give an overall impression of the each book without sounding like a reviewer (as much as possible).  In particular I must recommend <a href=#fermat><i>Fermat's Enigma</i></a>, which is much more historical than mathematical and is exceptionally interesting and well-written.

<tr><td><a href=books/histofpi.jpg><img src=books/histofpi-small.jpg width=100 height=152 alt="A History of Pi" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0312381859")><font color=772266><i>A History of &pi;</i></font></a> by Petr Beckmann (189 pages):  This is a great book written by an engineer.  Consequently it is free of mathematical prejudices, but it is nonetheless a little outdated and full of strong opinions (especially about the former Soviet Union, which begins to detract from the focus of the book).  There are some great chapters on Newton and Euler, and Beckmann always does a good job of including the people of the mathematics in addition to the actual topics.
<tr><td><a href=books/joyofpi.jpg><img src=books/joyofpi-small.jpg width=100 height=99 alt="The Joy of Pi" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0802775624")><font color=772266><i>The Joy of &pi;</i></font></a> by David Blatner (123 pages):  As informative as it is interesting, this light-hearted book discusses everything about &pi;, from bizarre formulas to mnemonic devices.  It reads very quickly and includes hundreds of trivia about everyone's favorite transcendental number.
<tr><td><a href=books/mathematical.jpg><img src=books/mathematical-small.jpg width=100 height=151 alt="The Mathematical Universe" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0471176613")><font color=772266><i>The Mathematical Universe</i></font></a> by William Dunham (296 pages):  Simply "an alphabetical journey through the great proofs, problems, and personalities," as the cover states.  The book touches on twenty-six mathematical topics of interest to the layman, from proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem to experimentation with integral calculus, but even the mathematically experienced reader will learn something new.
<tr><td><a href=books/divine.jpg><img src=books/divine-small.jpg width=100 height=157 alt="The Divine Proportion" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0486222543")><font color=772266><i>The Divine Proportion</i></font></a> by H. E. Huntley (178 pages):  An exposition all about the "golden" ratio <i>&phi;</i>, this book wonderfully reveals the appearance of its eponym in hundreds of simple mathematical situations that are both surprising and though-provoking.  It is quick to read and contains insight that is accessible to anyone into the beauty of mathematics.
<tr><td><a href=books/storyofe.jpg><img src=books/storyofe-small.jpg width=100 height=153 alt="e" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0691058547")><font color=772266><i>e</i></font></a> by Eli Maor (215 pages):  At times Maor's book left me wondering how justified an entire work about <i>e</i> was, especially when written for an audience generally unfamiliar with the most common appearances of the number.  As he writes himself, "The history of &pi; goes back to ancient times; that of <i>e</i> spans only about four centuries."  Consequently much of the book has little to do with <i>e</i> and instead consists of preliminary and background math needed to understand why, for instance, <i>e</i> is the ideal logarithmic base when finding derivatives and integrals.  However, there are some surprisingly good parts in the book, including a few discussions of transcendental numbers and a great chapter on imaginary powers deriving properties of logarithms of complex numbers &#151; which isn't seen by mathematics students until a class on complex analysis.
<tr><td><a href=books/infinity.jpg><img src=books/infinity-small.jpg width=100 height=152 alt="To Infinity and Beyond" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0691025118")><font color=772266><i>To Infinity and Beyond</i></font></a> by Eli Maor (259 pages):  This book (unlike Maor's on <i>e</i>) adheres strictly to its topic, bringing to light a good amount of history and a good number of applications and oddities surrounding the properties of the infinite.  I especially enjoyed the discussion of projective geometry, which is fascinating and wholly accessible to the non-mathematician, as well as the discussion of infinity in set theory.  Also important is that this book reaches beyond mathematics; it explores infinity in physics, art, and philosophy, providing a rounded approach to the subject.
<tr><td><a href=books/imaginary.jpg><img src=books/imaginary-small.jpg width=100 height=160 alt="The Story of &#8730;&#150;1" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0691027951")><font color=772266><i>The Story of </i>&#8730;&#150;1</font></a> by Paul J. Nahin (250 pages):  Not a typical "math for the populous" book, this is an intriguing story written by an electrical engineer, which naturally makes the subjects more applied.  Nahin includes some great stories, a lot of equations, and several historical notes of interest that make the book complete.
<tr><td><a href=books/zero.jpg><img src=books/zero-small.jpg width=100 height=155 alt="Zero" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("067088457X")><font color=772266><i>Zero</i></font></a> by Charles Seife (230 pages):  "The Biography of a Dangerous Idea," this book details the history of 0 (both the number and the concept), noting its role in many major mathematical developments along the way.  As the author fully realizes and conveys, the development of 0 remarkably parallels that of infinity, making for a wonderful trip through mathematics.
<tr><td><a href=books/codebook.jpg><img src=books/codebook-small.jpg width=100 height=153 alt="The Code Book" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0385495323")><font color=772266><i>The Code Book</i></font></a> by Simon Singh (350 pages):  This book is a delightful tour of the history of encryption with in-depth appendices and several cipher-cracking challenges for the reader.  Encryption techniques of history are described clearly and in detail.  It includes a surprisingly good explanation of the basics of quantum mechanics and its pertinence to cryptography.
<tr><a id=fermat></a><td><a href=books/fermats.jpg><img src=books/fermats-small.jpg width=100 height=153 alt="Fermat's Enigma" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0385493622")><font color=772266><i>Fermat's Enigma</i></font></a> by Simon Singh (285 pages):  This is the complete story of Fermat's Last Theorem, told by the mathematician who directed the <a href=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof><font color=772266>NOVA documentary</font></a>.  It is quite broad in its emphases but manages to provide a detailed account of both the history and progress of the proof of the theorem without a large detour into the actual mathematics.
<tr><td><a href=books/natures.jpg><img src=books/natures-small.jpg width=100 height=153 alt="Nature's Numbers" border=0><td><a href=javascript:amazon("0465072747")><font color=772266><i>Nature's Numbers</i></font></a> by Ian Stewart (150 pages):  Written primarily for people interested in math (theoretically perhaps) but not necessarily mathematically adept, <i>Nature's Numbers</i> is an interesting view of math without math.  Stewart brings to the reader's attention many fascinating patterns and similarities between phenomena of vastly different scales, linking most everything in nature to life-like processes.  It includes an enlightening discussion on chaos.
