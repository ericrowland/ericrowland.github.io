<p><a id=1></a>What is the radius of a sphere circumscribed around a cube?
<br><b>Hint:</b>  Consider a triangle defined by two segments:  that from center of the cube to a vertex and another from the center of the cube to the center of a face touching that vertex.

<p><a id=2></a>What is the height of the regular tetrahedron?
<br><b>Hint:</b>  Consider the right triangle formed by the height and a side.

<p><a id=3></a>What is the volume of the regular tetrahedron?
<br><b>Hint:</b>  The volume of a pyramid is <i>h A</i> / 3, where <i>h</i> is the height and <i>A</i> is the area of the base.

<p><a id=4></a>What is the volume of the regular octahedron?
<br><b>Hint:</b>  Break the octahedron into smaller pieces.

<p><a id=5></a>What is the volume of the regular icosahedron?
<br><b>Hint:</b>  Break up the icosahedron into twenty congruent triangular pyramids.  The height of each pyramid can be found by examining a cross-section of the icosahedron.
