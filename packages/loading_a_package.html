<p>
There are a few different ways to load a package in <i>Mathematica</i>.
The quick and dirty way (if your browser displays the contents of the .m file as text) is to copy the whole contents of the package, paste it into <i>Mathematica</i>, and Shift+Enter to evaluate it.
The drawback of this method is that it makes a big mess in the notebook.

<p><br>
A slicker way of loading a package is to import it directly from the web.
For example, the following loads the package <a href="https://people.hofstra.edu/Eric_Rowland/packages.html#IntegerSequences">IntegerSequences</a>.

<pre>Import["https://people.hofstra.edu/Eric_Rowland/packages/IntegerSequences.m"]</pre>

<p><br>
If you intend to use a package more than once, it's probably better to download it.
A good place to download packages is the Applications subdirectory of <b>$UserBaseDirectory</b>, which you can open by evaluating the following.

<pre>SystemOpen[FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]]</pre>

(Any of the directories listed when you evaluate <b>$Path</b> will work.)

<p>
Then you can load it by evaluating the following.

<pre>&lt;&lt;IntegerSequences`</pre>

<p>
(That last character is a backtick (reverse single quotation mark), which is located to the left of the '1' key on US keyboards.)

<p>
To see all the symbols available in the package, evaluate the following.

<pre>?IntegerSequences`*</pre>
