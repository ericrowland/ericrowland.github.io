<p>
<i>The Hierarchy of Integer Sequences</i> is an introduction to combinatorics through the lens of integer sequences.
It proceeds up the hierarchy, from relatively simple sequences to more sophisticated sequences, exploring the relationship between the complexity of a sequence and the complexity of the objects it counts.
</p>

<p>
Roughly half is written.
Since I don't have a lot of time to write, I expect the project won't be finished for some time, so I have decided to post the current draft so that interested people can start getting use out of it.
There is currently enough material for a one-semester undergraduate combinatorics course.
</p>

<p>
Since this is an early draft, things will change.
Specifically, the numbered questions at the end of each chapter are extremely likely to get assigned different numbers later.
Theorem numbers may also change.

<p>
Feedback is welcome!
If you find an error (or even a minor typo), please please let me know!
If you find the book useful, that would also be great to hear.
If you are looking forward to reading the rest of it, that would probably be even better to hear, since it will motivate me to find time to work on it!
